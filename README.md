## Assignments 00 to 05

### 00 - Introduction & Basic Python Scripts
Welcome to Python! This section introduces fundamental concepts such as syntax, variables, running Python scripts, displaying output, accepting user input, and performing basic calculations.

### 01 - Expressions
Expressions form the backbone of Python programming. This section explores mathematical operations, logical conditions, and variable manipulations to create meaningful computations.

### 02 - Lists
Lists are a fundamental data structure in Python. Here, youâ€™ll learn how to create lists, access elements using indexing and slicing, modify lists, and perform common operations like appending, sorting, and iterating through lists.

### 03 - Dictionaries
Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs, making them a powerful tool for efficient lookups. This section covers dictionary creation, value retrieval, adding and removing elements, and iterating through dictionary items.

### 04 - If Statements
Decision-making is key to programming! This section explains how to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to execute code conditionally based on logical expressions.

### 05 - Loops & Control Flow
Loops allow efficient execution of repetitive tasks. Learn how to use `for` and `while` loops, along with control flow mechanisms like `break`, `continue`, and `pass` to manage program execution.

### 06 - Functions
Functions promote modular and reusable code. This section covers function definitions, argument passing, return values, and best practices for writing clean, maintainable functions.

### 07 - Information Flow
Understanding how data moves within a program is crucial for efficient coding. This section delves into variable scope, data transfer between functions, and best practices for organizing code effectively.

Each assignment in this module includes practical exercises to reinforce your Python skills. Happy coding! ðŸš€

## ðŸŽ¨ Enhancing Terminal Output with ANSI Escape Codes

### What Are ANSI Escape Codes?
ANSI escape codes are special character sequences that allow you to control text formatting, colors, and cursor movement in terminal displays. These codes work seamlessly on Linux, macOS, and supported Windows terminals.

### Why Use ANSI Escape Codes?
- Add color to terminal output
- Apply bold, italic, or underline styles
- Improve readability and highlight key information
- Reset formatting when needed

### Code Effect Example Usage in Python Output

```python
# Reset formatting
\033[0m  # Reset Text
print("\033[0mReset Text")  # Output: Reset Text

# Bold text
\033[1m  # Bold Text
print("\033[1mBold Text\033[0m")  # Output: Bold Text

# Italic text
\033[3m  # Italic Text
print("\033[3mItalic Text\033[0m")  # Output: Italic Text

# Underlined text
\033[4m  # Underlined Text
print("\033[4mUnderlined Text\033[0m")  # Output: Underlined Text

# Red text
\033[31m  # Red Text
print("\033[31mRed Text\033[0m")  # Output: ðŸ”´ Red Text

# Green text
\033[32m  # Green Text
print("\033[32mGreen Text\033[0m")  # Output: ðŸŸ¢ Green Text

# Yellow text
\033[33m  # Yellow Text
print("\033[33mYellow Text\033[0m")  # Output: ðŸŸ¡ Yellow Text

# Blue text
\033[34m  # Blue Text
print("\033[34mBlue Text\033[0m")  # Output: ðŸ”µ Blue Text

# Bold Yellow
\033[1;33m  # Bold Yellow
print("\033[1;33mBold Yellow\033[0m")  # Output: ðŸŸ¡ Bold Yellow

# Bold Blue
\033[1;34m  # Bold Blue
print("\033[1;34mBold Blue\033[0m")  # Output: ðŸ”µ Bold Blue
